 this php script will convert a 6 hex character ICAO code
 for a U.S civilian aircraft to it's
 corresponding registration (Tail) number.

 the hex code can either be supplied on the command line as an argument
 or can be supplied when the script is activated.

 valid input range is from A00001 to ADF7C7


this script calculates the registration from the ICAO code
 but the resulting registration may not currently be in use.

 this script will also convert from registration to
 the corresponding ICAO code
